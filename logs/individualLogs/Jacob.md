## Week 5: September 29 - October 5

I was absent on Monday but joined the team on Wednesday when we were finalizing our Data Flow Diagrams (Levels 0 and 1). During that session, I helped review the process connections and verified that all data stores, inputs, and outputs were correctly linked. I also contributed to checking for any missing internal processes and ensuring that the diagrams accurately reflected the systemâ€™s workflow*

## Week 4: September 22 - 28

*This week, I examined integration and compatibility options for several third-party APIs and backend systems. I analyzed the potential impact of various authentication models, data structures, and rate-limiting behaviors on our architecture, identifying integration risks and outlining strategies for risk mitigation. At the same time, I made considerable progress on expanding the use-case section of our project proposal.*
