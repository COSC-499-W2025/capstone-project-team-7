## Week 6: October 6th - 12th

This week, I put my efforts into establishing the file hierarchy within the development environment we are working on. The creation of the first folders and files required for the project took place along with the addition of inline documentation to each file. The documentation covers the file's purpose, the functionality aimed at, and any future implementations that might need to be added are written as comments. Team collaboration will be simpler with this structure, as it will be clear for everybody through the documentation where each part is going to be placed while the system is still being built.

## Week 5: September 29 - October 5

I was absent on Monday but joined the team on Wednesday when we were finalizing our Data Flow Diagrams (Levels 0 and 1). During that session, I helped review the process connections and verified that all data stores, inputs, and outputs were correctly linked. I also contributed to checking for any missing internal processes and ensuring that the diagrams accurately reflected the systemâ€™s workflow*

## Week 4: September 22 - 28

*This week, I examined integration and compatibility options for several third-party APIs and backend systems. I analyzed the potential impact of various authentication models, data structures, and rate-limiting behaviors on our architecture, identifying integration risks and outlining strategies for risk mitigation. At the same time, I made considerable progress on expanding the use-case section of our project proposal.*
