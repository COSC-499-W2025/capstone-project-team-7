# Week 5: September 29 - October 5

This week I worked with my team to create our Data Flow Diagrams for Level 0 and Level 1. First we figured out the main processes in our system and organizing them into a simple list. After we built the diagrams together. We made a few changes to make sure the data flow between each process made sense. Finally, we adjusted the layout to match the examples shown in class.
