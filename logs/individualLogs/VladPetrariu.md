# Week 6: October 6 - October 12

After reviewing the milestone 1 requirements, I was focused on developing the proof of concept for the user consent and upload gate component of our system. I designed and docuented a process that would make sure that users procide explicit consent before any data is uploaded or analyzed. The POC I worked on this week includes a blueprint for the consent interface, validation logic, and integration details using supabase for authentication and database storage. I make a full technical design, database schema, row-level security policies and storage layout for ulpoaded files. I defined validation rules and relevant output responses. Next week I plan to start implementing the POC with Supabase and demonstrate a working consent flow.

# Week 5: September 29 - October 5

This week I worked with my team to create our Data Flow Diagrams for Level 0 and Level 1. First we figured out the main processes in our system and organizing them into a simple list. After we built the diagrams together. We made a few changes to make sure the data flow between each process made sense. Finally, we adjusted the layout to match the examples shown in class.

# Week 4: September 21 - 28

This week I worked on the proposed solution for the project proposal.

# Week 3: September 15 - 21
