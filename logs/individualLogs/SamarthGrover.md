## Week 3: September 15 - 21 
This week I worked alongside my team to set up the foundation for the project including the git repository and docs setup. We discussed the project overview and wrote out the functional and non-functional requirements by going in depth and understanding what was needed to build the project.

Missed lecture due to sickness during this week.
