## Week 6: October 6 - October 12

*This week was spent refining the project documents including the Data Flow Diagram, Requirements and the System Architecture diagram as well. After taking a look at the milestone 1 requirements we realised there were some missing components such as the consent process from the user and we were able to add it to our current design for the system. Except that I was able to contribute to the discussions of our repository structure which will allow us to move forward with adding actual code and logic starting next week. I also spent quite a bit of time this week diving into the documentation for Docker and understanding how it works.*

## Week 5: September 29 - October 5

*Most of the time this week had gone towards working on our Data Flow Diagrams (Level 0 and 1). I started off with listing out the basic processes that would be communicating with each other in the system. Once we had our processes listed out, we decided as a team if there were any other processes in the intermediary or if we had any redundant processes that could be eliminated. After this exercise, we landed on the conclusion of our final 7 processes. Now we just had to start drawing out our lines connecting the processes while making sure we are not missing out any internal processes that happened such as the rescanning that kept happening while the system was being used. Once all the data processes were connected we moved on to bridge the gap between the storage for our data with the inputs and outputs of the processes.*

## Week 4: September 22 - 28

*I spent a bunch of my time on the system architecture this week. Once we had that in place with the requirements from last week, I then started doing some research on what tech stack would satisfy our needs. After some discussions with the team and some more research we narrowed down on the technology we will be using. Furthermore, I worked on the functional requirements, test cases for them and the technology stack parts of the Project Proposal.*

## Week 3: September 15 - 21 

*I worked on adding the functional requirements in the project requirements document alongside coming up with some ideas for the non-funcntional requirements. I also added the usage scenario and target user group for the project as well. I setup some starter directories and files for our documentation and log setup.*
