## Week 4: September 22 - 28

*I spent a bunch of my time on the system architecture this week. Once we had that in place with the requirements from last week, I then started doing some research on what tech stack would satisfy our needs. After some discussions with the team and some more research we narrowed down on the technology we will be using. Furthermore, I worked on the functional requirements, test cases for them and the technology stack parts of the Project Proposal.*

## Week 3: September 15 - 21 

*I worked on adding the functional requirements in the project requirements document alongside coming up with some ideas for the non-funcntional requirements. I also added the usage scenario and target user group for the project as well. I setup some starter directories and files for our documentation and log setup.*
