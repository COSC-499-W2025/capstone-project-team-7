## Week 5 (September 29th - October 5th)
This week I worked on the data flow diagram and on fixing our repo structure. On Monday me and my group finished designing the DFD level 0 which was super simple, and we began discussing what our level 1 diagram would look like. Instead of drawing right away, I suggested it'd be better to first define our processes and writing down the interactions between them. At the end of Monday's class we had the diagram on paper (text) and we had used Lucid Chart to draw Level 0 and the first few nodes of Level 1. Before Wednesday's class, I went over the finished version of our diagram and changed the shapes we used to make sure they matched the ones given in the lecture, and printed the diagrams to share with other groups. When we compared diagrams, we noticed that some groups had issues like missing data stores or not reusing the same store across processes, which made their flows harder to follow. Also, during that class I realized we had improperly placed our logs directory in the docs directory, so I spent part of that class moving our stuff into its correct place and making sure everything stayed as is.

## Week 4 (September 22nd - 28th)
This week I worked on creating the first version of our system diagram using mermaid.live. In the next class, I discussed it with other groups and compared our architecture with theirs, which helped me see where our flow wasnâ€™t very clear. After that, we talked as a team about how we were going to split the project proposal, and then I focused on the UML use case diagram and use case scenarios alongside Jacob. Making the diagram readable was a bit challenging with all the arrows and interactions, but we managed to get it done and I added the updated architecture diagram to our repo.

## Week 3 (September 15th - 21st)
This week I worked on defining the requirements and setting up our repo and our Google Drive folder for our documentation, adding the link to it on our README file. Also, I focused on improving our target user group and the usage scenarios. I based off the initial project details given on canvas and worked on turning them into more specific requirements. Then, in class, I discussed with members of other groups about our requirements and theirs, and looked like all groups were more or less on the same page, except most of them had defined a tech stack while we had not.
