# Joaquin Almora / @joaquinalmora

## Week 4 (September 22nd - 28th)
This week I worked on creating the first version of our system diagram using mermaid.live. In the next class, I discussed it with other groups and compared our architecture with theirs, which helped me see where our flow wasnâ€™t very clear. After that, we talked as a team about how we were going to split the project proposal, and then I focused on the UML use case diagram and use case scenarios alongside Jacob. Making the diagram readable was a bit challenging with all the arrows and interactions, but we managed to get it done and I added the updated architecture diagram to our repo.

## Week 3 (September 15th - 21st)
This week I worked on defining the requirements and setting up our repo and our Google Drive folder for our documentation, adding the link to it on our README file. Also, I focused on improving our target user group and the usage scenarios. I based off the initial project details given on canvas and worked on turning them into more specific requirements. Then, in class, I discussed with members of other groups about our requirements and theirs, and looked like all groups were more or less on the same page, except most of them had defined a tech stack while we had not.
