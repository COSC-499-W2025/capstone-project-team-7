## Week 6: October 6 - October 12

*This week was spent refining the project documents including the Data Flow Diagram, Requirements and the System Architecture diagram as well. After taking a look at the milestone 1 requirements we realised there were some missing components such as the consent process from the user and we were able to add it to our current design for the system. I specifically worked on refining the WBS based on the new requirements and the document has now been added to the codebase. Except that I was able to contribute to the discussions of our repository structure which will allow us to move forward with adding actual code and logic starting next week. I also spent quite a bit of time this week diving into the documentation for Docker and understanding how it works.*

*This week, I spent lots of time studying Docker documentation and understanding how to implement it in our project. Aside from that, I made a code contribution which involed including a template for our fast api backend service. The commit I made will allow our team to move forward with implementing our backend api routes in the future. It involved ensuring using the FastAPI library and uvicorn to test our routes on a default ip to ensure we get a 200 status code. Apart from that, I discussed refinements we can make to our DFD and System architecture diagrams.

## Week 5: September 29 - October 5

*This week, my team and I worked on our DFD level 0 and level 1 diagrams. This entailed us identifying all the key proccees our application would have, and how these processes would communicate with one another. Next, we used a program called Lucid chart to define all the key entities in our DFD's. We then connected all our processes through the key entities, such as connecting the authentication entity to manage the configuration entity, as the user should only be able to manage scanning settings if they are authenticated. On Wednesday, I discussed the DFD's with team 4, team 13, and team 18. I learned some key points from each team during these discussions such as how to better improve our data flow.*

## Week 4: September 22 - 28

*This week, I focused on designing the system architecture diagram with my team. I assisted in figuring out the different layers we would be utilizing and the technologies within each layer. For example, for the service layer, we decided to use REST API. I then worked on the "Requirements, Testing, Requirement Verification" with om in which I worked on the non functional requirements, test cases, and difficulty levels*

## Week 3: September 15 - 21 
This week, I worked on defining the non-functional requirements and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for our personal artifact discovery and portfolio system. I established performance benchmarks like scanning 1GB of data within 5 seconds and supporting up to 10,000 files, along with security requirements ensuring all user data stays local and encrypted. For the WBS, I organized the project into four phases over 16 weeks: Foundation (research and requirements), System Architecture Design, Database & API Design, and User Interface & Integration. Each phase has clear deliverables and timelines to guide our development of this portfolio tool for graduating students. This planning work provides the technical foundation and project roadmap we need to move forward with implementation.
