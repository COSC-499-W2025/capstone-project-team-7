## Week 4 (September 22nd - 28th)

## Week 3 (September 15th - 21st)
This week I worked on defining the requirements and setting up our repo and our Google Drive folder for our documentation, adding the link to it on our README file. Also, I focused on improving our target user group and the usage scenarios. I based off the initial project details given on canvas and worked on turning them into more specific requirements. Then, in class, I discussed with members of other groups about our requirements and theirs, and looked like all groups were more or less on the same page, except most of them had defined a tech stack while we had not.
