## Week 4: September 22 - 28

*
This week, I examined integration and compatibility options for several third-party APIs and backend systems. I analyzed the potential impact of various authentication models, data structures, and rate-limiting behaviors on our architecture, identifying integration risks and outlining strategies for risk mitigation. At the same time, I made considerable progress on expanding the use-case section of our project proposal.
