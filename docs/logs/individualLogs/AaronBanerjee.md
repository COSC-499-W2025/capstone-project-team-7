<b>Week 3: September 15 - 21 </b>

This week, I worked on defining the non-functional requirements and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for our personal artifact discovery and portfolio system. I established performance benchmarks like scanning 1GB of data within 5 seconds and supporting up to 10,000 files, along with security requirements ensuring all user data stays local and encrypted. For the WBS, I organized the project into four phases over 16 weeks: Foundation (research and requirements), System Architecture Design, Database & API Design, and User Interface & Integration. Each phase has clear deliverables and timelines to guide our development of this portfolio tool for graduating students. This planning work provides the technical foundation and project roadmap we need to move forward with implementation.
