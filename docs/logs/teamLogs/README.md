# Capstone Team 7 Logs

## Week 3 (September 15 - 21)

We worked on developing ideas for the functional and non-functional requirements for the Project Requirements document. Additionally, we added information regarding the target user group and usage scenarios. We also spent time discussing the requirements in class and learning about other teams' requirements as well. One thing we noticed we did not do that other teams did was define a tech stack, but we think it would be better to define our tech stack once we have more defined project specifications.


## Week 4 (September 22 - 28)

This week we focused on the system architecture and the project proposal.

For the architecture, we first made a detailed component diagram that broke down each layer and described the components inside them. While it helped us see exactly what pieces exist in the system, the problem was that the flow of information wasn’t obvious, the arrows just went from one layer to the next without showing how data would actually move. After discussing, we made a second diagram that was less detailed but much clearer in terms of flow. The first diagram works well for showing system structure, while the second works better for understanding process flow. Together they allow for a pretty good understanding of the system.

We also finished the project proposal, which included:
- Usage scenario (Samarth)  
- Proposed solution (Vlad)  
- Use cases (Joaquin & Jacob) – covering artifact discovery, analysis, privacy, reporting, search/filter, etc.  
- Requirements & testing (Om & Aaron) – both functional and non-functional, linked to test frameworks (Jest, Playwright, etc.), with difficulty levels assigned.
