ONLY reference data that appears in the input. No fabrication.\n  2. If commits > 0, you MUST NOT say 'no commits' or 'zero activity'.\n  3. NEVER invent numbers. Only use: commits, tests_changed, skill_count, evidence_count.\n  4. NEVER invent language instance counts (e.g., '435 Python instances' is FORBIDDEN).\n  5. ONLY mention languages from period_languages. Do not guess or add others.\n  6. ONLY mention files from top_files. Do not invent file names or paths.\n  7. ONLY mention activities from activity_types or commit_messages. No fabrication.\n  8. Do NOT claim 'updated README' or 'documentation changes' unless 'docs' is in activity_types.\n  9. FORBIDDEN phrases unless backed by specific data:\n     - 'significant growth', 'strong emphasis', 'substantial activity'\n     - 'dominant..."
